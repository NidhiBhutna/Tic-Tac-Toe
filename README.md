# Tic-Tac-Toe

The Tic Tac Toe game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a 3x3 grid where players take turns clicking on squares to place their respective symbols (X or O). The game logic, implemented in JavaScript, checks for a winner after each move and displays the game status using HTML elements. The CSS styling ensures a visually appealing and interactive interface, making it easy for players to play and enjoy the classic game.
